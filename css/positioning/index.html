    <h3>Static - the default, follow the document flow</h3>

    <div class="parent">
      Parent
      <div class="child-one">One</div>
      <div class="child-two">Two</div>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Relative - "RELATIVE TO SELF" or "NUDGE" from where static would put it</h3>
    <p>Relative with no adjustments acts broadly like static</p>
    <p>The other elements just assume its where it would have been with static positioning</p>
    <p>Note it moves the element in such a way that it actually overflows the items around it</p>
    <p>position: relative; left: 40px; top: 10px;</p>
    <div class="parent">
      Parent
      <div class="child-one child-relative">One</div>
      <div class="child-two">Two</div>
    </div>

    <h3>Absolute - removes object so that flow ignores its existence</h3>
    <p>The other elements in this case literally assume that the absolute element no longer exists</p>
    <p>IMPORTANTLY, the left, right, top, bottom adjustments are based on the position element of the parent</p>
    <p>If the parent is static, the adjustments are to the top left of the screen - unlikely this is useful</p>
    <p>If the parent is relative (or absolute), the adjustments are to the top left of the parent - VERY USEFUL</p>
    <p>position: absolute; left: 80px; top: 20px (parent position is relative in this case)</p>
    <div class="parent parent-relative">
      Parent
      <div class="child-one child-absolute">One</div>
      <div class="child-two">Two</div>
    </div>

    <h3>Fixed - as absolute but always positioned relative to the html, not the parent</h3>
    <p>The element literally doesn't move even when scrolling down</p>
    <p>Seems to position in its normal static position until left, right, etc. are applied then relative to the html element </p>
    <p>See bototm right fxhash notification for a common use case</p>
    <p>position: fixed; top: 820px; left: 150px;</p>
    
    <div class="parent">
      Parent
      <div class="child-one child-fixed">Fixed One, I don't move even when scrolled</div>
      <div class="child-two">Two</div>
    </div>

    <div class="fxhash-notification">
      <p>Example of fixed - notifications on objkt or fxhash</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Sticky - "STATIC THEN STUBBORNLY FIXED"</h3>
    <p>This is basically static until it is to be scrolled off page, at which point it become fixed</p>
    <p>Seems to be restricted to the bounds of its parent though</p>
    <p>This is how you get the cool scroll effects!</p>
   
    <div class="parent" style="height:400px">
      Parent
      <div class="child-one child-sticky">Sticky One</div>
      <div class="child-two">Two</div>
    </div>
